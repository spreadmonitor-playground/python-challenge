# Python Challenge

The goal of this hackathon was to solve as many puzzles from the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) as possible, not in Python but an another language we are unfamiliar with.

> **Disclaimer:** The code you will find in the files are probably very far from the right way of writing code in Swift.  

### The language selection

We proposed the following languages: [Typescript][typescript], [Python][python], [Rust][rust], [Go][go], [Dart][dart], Java, C#, [Swift][swift] or [Haskell][haskell].

After some discussion we agreed on the following criteria: 
 - try some new language we have no experience in
 - use some lower level language
 - try to stick with the default libs of the language, so no external libraries

In the end we decided to go with Swift over Rust because of the very strict compile-time requirements of Rust. We were afraid we would fight the compiler instead of trying to solve the puzzles.

### The process 

We solved the problems in a group where everyone was trying to come up with a solution to the current challenge and share the problems/findings found along the way.
